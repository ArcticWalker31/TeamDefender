Hello World!

It feels great starting on a new project. Here are some of my ideas for this one.
These are just ideas and I am open to changes or new ones.


Multiplayer
Game of 3-6
All the players work together to survive
Different roles, Pilot, engineer, gunner
Pilot steers the ship to avoid enemies and collect resources
engineer builds and upgrades the parts of the ship, unlocking things for the whole team
gunner fends off the alieans attacking

This is a basic idea. Needs details and improvements.
